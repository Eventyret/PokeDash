				<p><b>Pokémon Battles in the general:</b></p>
				<p>Battles between Pokémon are the central game mechanic of the Pokémon games. They are used to train Pokémon to become
					stronger, as competitions, and to reach certain objectives within the game. Battling can also be done between players
					by connecting two games.</p>
				<p>Pokémon uses a turn-based system. When the player challenges a Trainer or encounters a wild Pokémon, the screen changes
					to a battle scene with the player's Pokémon, the opposing Pokémon, their respective HP bars, and an option menu. At
					any time, the player may carry up to six Pokémon in his or her active party; the first Pokémon in the lineup is automatically
					sent into battle. At the start of each turn, both sides can choose to attack, use an item, switch the Pokémon for another
					in their party, or attempt to flee from battle (against a wild Pokémon). If both sides attack, the one who goes first
					is determined by Speed, although some moves, items, and effects can override this. If either side chooses any other
					option, that action is performed before the attacks.</p>
				<p>Each Pokémon uses moves to reduce their opponent's HP to zero, at which point the Pokémon faints (ひんし hinshi) and
					is unable to battle. (In the Pokémon world, Pokémon never die as a result of battling.) If the player's Pokémon wins,
					it receives experience points; when enough have accumulated, the Pokémon's level increases. If the player's Pokémon
					faints, he/she may use another Pokémon; in battles against wild Pokémon, the player may attempt to flee instead. If
					all of a player's Pokémon have fainted, the player loses the battle. This causes the player to lose some money and return
					to the last Pokémon Center he or she visited.</p>

				<p><b>This Simulation Game:</b></p>
				<p><br />In this simulation, the winner is chosen by random, it's only meant to simulate a pokemon battle.<br />Once
					the fight starts the counter will reach five (5) and a winner is selected by random.</p>
				<p>If by popular demand I would love to make this more robust and add HP and a proper challenge game.<br />But for now,
					this was a proof of concept and rather displaying it at random.</p>
				<p>If you would love to see this as a real game, please don't hesitate to open a <a href="https://www.github.com/eventyret/pokemonDashboard"
					 target="_blank">PR on Github.</a></p>
